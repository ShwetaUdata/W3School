                <p id="p">My experience as a Management Trainee at WCCLG for the past 8 months has been truly enriching, rewarding and a roller-coaster ride. I have worked across multiple sales roles so far and each stint surely has given me a different perspective of the business.Working on the field, understanding ground zero problems and solving them to smoothen the business flow has been an exciting journey. I have gone through multiple challenges that come with each responsibility, learnt to overcome them and understand the integration of different business verticals.I am now excited to move forward, experience other roles and continue learning & contributing throughout my journey here</p>

                 <p id="ul">The management trainee program has been about understanding the intricacies of the industry through hands-on experiences, across a diverse set of geographies, roles, and markets. Over the past 8 months we’ve been to 5-6 cities, and worked in 2-3 roles each with their own challenges and learning opportunities.Each stint involved an initial hand-holding period, followed by an independent charge. This complete immersion in the market offered multiple opportunities to understand the levers of each stakeholder- the front-line sales personnel, the distribution network, and the local sales team. The freedom to implement any idea directly in the market, enabled us to dive-in and understand these levers.The reviews with the senior leaders helped in appreciating the on-field learnings from the broader perspective of the brand and sales strategy teams, making the program all the more enriching</p>

                    <h id="ul"><b>Dipayan Sinha, (IIM Bangalore, 2015)</b><br> (Assistant Brand Manager, Wipro Consumer Care)<br></h></center>
                    <p id="ul">I joined Wipro Consumer Care as a Management Trainee in May, 2015. Since I did not have any prior work-experience, this was my first tryst with corporate life. WCCLG’s one-year MT programme is very well-structured and enables the trainee to get familiar with the way the organization functions and conducts its business. The programme was broadly split between the Sales and Marketing trainings. Sales was much more hands-on with a lot of emphasis on the Salesman and the Sales Officer stints, where we were expected to work independently in order to deliver sales numbers and achieve targets. We were introduced to both the General Trade and the Modern Trade business channels and were made to understand the differences in their respective functioning. The Marketing part involved doing live projects in stints such as Market Research and Advertising, and even working out of agencies’ offices. We also got a good glimpse of Brand Management by actually working on the re-launch project of the Yardley brand. Overall, the Management Trainee programme helped us stand in very good stead when we joined the organization as Assistant Brand Managers. The mix of Sales and Marketing trainings ensured that whatever strategies we formulate from the brand’s perspective are never disconnected from the realities in the market. I work in the New Product Development & Innovations team and my current project involves launching a new category in India. The work is a nice mix of operational and strategic activities, with ample scope of learning on-the-job. Overall, I see a good prospect of career growth in the role, as well as in the organization</p>
