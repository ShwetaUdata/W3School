        <p id="p">During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited. In 1982, the name was changed again, from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited. In 1999, Wipro was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[citation needed] In 2004, Wipro became the second Indian IT company to earn US$1 billion in annual revenue. In 2012, Wipro demerged its non-IT businesses into a separate company called Wipro Enterprises. Prior to this demerger, these businesses, mainly in the consumer care, lighting, furniture, hydraulics, water treatment, and medical diagnostics, contributed about 10% of Wipro's total revenues. In March 2023, Wipro opened its American international headquarters at Tower Center in East Brunswick. Wipro Limited (NYSE: WIT, BSE: 507685, NSE: WIPRO) is a leading technology services and consulting company focused on building innovative solutions that address clients most complex digital transformation needs. We leverage our holistic portfolio of capabilities in consulting, design, engineering, operations, and emerging technologies to help clients realize their boldest ambitions and build future-ready, sustainable businesses. A company recognized globally for its comprehensive portfolio of services, strong commitment to sustainability and good corporate citizenship, we have over 245,000 dedicated employees serving clients across 65 countries.</p>
        <p id="p">The state government has also engaged Deloitte, E&Y, PwC, and KPMG for preparing the commercial RFP (request for proposal). The e-Pragati project will cover 33 secretariat departments and over 300 government agencies in the state. It aims to provide 745 services in the government to customer (G2C), government to business (G2B), government to enterprise (G2E) and government to government (G2G) areas. It consists of 72 projects grouped into 14 packages. Based on the public-private partnership (PPP) model, the project will be implemented over a three-year period. The major components of e-Pragati revolve around seven missions, five grids and five campaigns. These include AP Fibre Grid up to all gram panchayats, AP State Data Centre to host all the data and applications, e-Highway to seamlessly connect all the departments digitally and People Hub to house all the socio-economic data of the citizens for effective implementation of welfare schemes and development programmes.In addition, the project covers social benefits management system covering welfare schemes, mSeva (a platform for providing a wide range of citizen services on mobile), e-AgriMarket (a platform that enables farmers to sell their produce online to get the best price) and e-Panchayat (enhances efficiency of Panchayati Raj institutions).</p>
        <p id="p">Wipro is India's third-largest information technology company. Like its rival Indian IT service providers, Wipro is a major IT business that operates around the world. The company has over 150,000 employees across the world, and posts about 80% of its sales outside India. Wipro's beginning was very different to other major Indian IT companies. It started as a vegetable oil producer in 1945. Azim Premji, the company's current chairman, became the head of the company in 1966 following the sudden death of his father. Under his leadership, Wipro broadened into other areas of business. The company entered the IT industry in the 1980s. It gradually shifted its emphasis from hardware production to offshore software development, building its foundation as a major IT company. Premji owns the majority of the company's shares. Non-IT businesses, including hydraulic cylinder manufacturing and household product operations, are currently managed by Wipro Enterprises, a group company.</p>
